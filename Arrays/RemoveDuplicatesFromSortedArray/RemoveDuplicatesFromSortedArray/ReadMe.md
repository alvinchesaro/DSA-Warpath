This was an interesting one, I told myself that it was going to be the first problem I ever solved without referring or asking for AI assitance. That was a lie.
I needed to refer, infer and ask AI. In the end,  Neetcode's solution wasn't even what did it for me. It was Teddy Smiths work out, which wasn't very well explained towards the end, but made sense. Especially the in-place bit, I had immediately gone for the remove the unique elements from the array, add them to a list and convert to an array, that would have messed with the space complexity and of course really challenged my time complexity. I hadn't understood that it was important for me to keep the array and not copy or delete from it. All the probelme required me to do was place the duplicates together, not modify the size of the array.

The solution is generic and commonly used.

Herein, there's a Fails.cs file, I'll explain it later.


It can be seen here, alongside Teddy's very nice explanation.
